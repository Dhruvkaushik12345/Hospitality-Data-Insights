Tourism Demographics and Revenue Dashboard for Hospitality Analytics

 1. Introduction:
 • This project looks at hotel booking data to find out about tourism trends, how customers behave, and how well the business is doing.

 • The goal is to find out who the guests are, when bookings are at their highest, and what causes cancellations and affects revenue.
 • Tools used: Python to clean the data and Power BI to make the dashboard and DAX insights.
 • Focus: Analyzing the demographics of tourists and the money they spend to help make decisions based on data.

 2. Cleaning up data (Python):

 • Got rid of duplicates and made sure that missing values for agents and companies were the same.
 • Changed the formats of numeric columns like lead_time, stays_in_week_nights, adr, and others to make them correct.
 • Merged the arrival date columns into one arrival_date field 
 
 for visuals that show time.

 • Created new fields:
 o Total Nights = stays on weekdays and weekends
 o The total number of guests is adults, children, and babies.
 o The booking status is either "Canceled" or "Not Canceled".
